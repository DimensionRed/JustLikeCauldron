# Key Features

- 🧭**Facing Blockstate:** Just Like Cauldron introduces a facing blockstate for cauldrons, allowing them to face in different directions. 
- 🍯**Honeycomb Waxing**: You can apply wax to any vanilla cauldron, regardless of whether it's empty or contains water (of any level), lava, or powder snow. Simply right-click a cauldron with honeycomb, and the blockstate will change accordingly.
- 🔃**Switch "Skins" with Wax**: Reapplying wax using honeycomb on a cauldron that’s already waxed will cycle through available "skins", i.e. **"data"** blockstate values (**from 0 to 7**). This allows you to switch between different looks easily without removing the wax.
- 🪓⛏️**Wax Removal**: To remove wax from a cauldron, just right-click it with an axe. This will reset the blockstate, allowing you to reapply wax if needed. A cauldron can also be mined using pickaxe to reset cauldron to the default "data" value.

# Decorative Customization
While the mod functions fine on its own, it's designed to work best alongside _resource packs_ that alter cauldrons based on a specific "data" value. By using resource packs, you can transform the look of cauldrons depending on the applied blockstate.
